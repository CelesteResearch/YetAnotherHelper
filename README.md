# YetAnotherHelper

Source port for the Shared runtime.

## Required files

- An original Celeste installation with `Celeste.dll` and `FNA.dll`.
- Original **YetAnotherHelper 1.2.5**: `YetAnotherHelper.zip`, available from the
  [supported archive](https://gamebanana.com/mmdl/1182393).
- The Workspace, Shared and Tools repositories. Host requirements are described
  in the [workspace README][workspace-readme].

Keep the archive intact; do not extract its DLL or edit its code. The archive and
embedded assembly hashes are recorded in [mod-rebuild.json](mod-rebuild.json).

Save the downloaded archive as `YetAnotherHelper.zip` in the original installation's `Mods` directory.

## Placement

```text
Workspace/
  Shared/
  Tools/
  Mods/
    YetAnotherHelper/                 # this repository

Celeste/                    # your original game installation
  Celeste.dll
  FNA.dll
  Mods/
    YetAnotherHelper.zip
```

Other required Mod archives stay together in the original installation's `Mods`
directory.

## Build

From the workspace directory, use the host options in the
[Tools README][tools-readme]. For example, for Godot:

```powershell
pwsh ./Tools/Prepare.ps1 `
  -CelesteDirectory '/path/to/Celeste' `
  -AudioBankDirectory '/path/to/Desktop' `
  -Targets Godot `
  -IncludeHelpers
```

Preparation builds the Shared and Helper projects and packages this source port
with the original content at `Content/Celeste/Mods/YetAnotherHelper.zip`.
Build and packaging tools use the workspace's ignored `artifacts/` directory.

After preparing Shared resources, the project can also be built directly:

```powershell
dotnet build ./Mods/YetAnotherHelper/Celeste.Mods.YetAnotherHelper.csproj -c Release
```
